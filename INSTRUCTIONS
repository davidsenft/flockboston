ADDING A NEW PRODUCT
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Catalog -> Manage Products -> Add Product
2. Select the appropriate "Attribute Set"
3. Select "Configurable Product" if there are multiple options (e.g. size and color) or "Simple Product" if the product only comes in one option
4. (ONLY IF THE PRODUCT IS CONFIGURABLE) Select which attributes have multiple options that shoppers can choose from (e.g. size, color, or both)
5. Enter all required information on the "General" tab
	> Name, descriptions, SKU, Status: "Enabled", Visibility: "Catalog, Search"
6. Enter the product's price and tax class on the "Price" tab
7. Upload images on the "Images" tab, then:
	> Choose base image (the default image on the product page)
	> Choose thumbnail image (when the image is small--probably same as base image)
	> Type "back" as the label for the alternate image that should show when hovering
8. Set inventory as "In Stock" on the "Inventory" tab
